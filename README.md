👋🏽 PROJECT INTRO
-ʔayʔaǰuθəm Tetris is an accessible way to practice the basics of Ayajuthem morphosyntax, AKA the way small units of language fit together to make meaningful words and sentences. Inspired by the nostalgic fun of Tetris, the effective teaching style of Duolingo, the UN’s decade of Indigenous Languages, and of course the Ayajuthem-speaking community for whom it is built and to whom it belongs 🧡

🎯 PROBLEM SPACE
-Language is culture, identity, health, power, and revitalization one of the cornerstones of decolonization. The boom of tech has made picking up up a new language easier than ever with popular apps such as Duolingo and Anki offering dozens of options for gamified learning, but still lacking in the space are tools for Indigenous languages and learners; most have to rely on organized classes which are few and far between. This leaves little opportunity for practice and advancement, particularly in communities where classes are not available. Adding to the challenge, Ayajuthem has complex morphological patterns that can be difficult to master as an English speaker, and it has been shared by community members that an engaging way to practice these patterns would benefit their learning experience -- ʔayʔaǰuθəm Tetris seeks to fill this want.

💪🏽 LESSONS LEARNED 
-Huge respect to game developers! Making an interactive game like this with so many moving parts and state changes was a big challenge as a junior dev, and it taught me a lot. Through this project I learned how to build my first database and connect it to a web app, how to deploy on both front and back end, how to use React hooks to manage state, and how to let users move page elements with keypress listeners, among many other things.

🚀 NEXT STEPS & BIG DREAMS
    -Deploy for community use
    -Add more data examples to increase play/learning opportunity
    -Create ability to change timer length
    -Add login functionality
    -Allow users to post their own example sentences
    -Add image to each example for visual aid
