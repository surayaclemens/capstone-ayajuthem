👋🏽 PROJECT INTRO
<br>ʔayʔaǰuθəm Tetris is an accessible way to practice the basics of Ayajuthem morphosyntax, AKA the way small units of language fit together to make meaningful words and sentences. Inspired by the nostalgic fun of Tetris, the effective teaching style of Duolingo, the UN’s decade of Indigenous Languages, and of course the Ayajuthem-speaking community for whom it is built and to whom it belongs 🧡
<br>I created this app as my capstone project in the final 2 weeks of my 12-week web development bootcamp

🎯 PROBLEM SPACE
<br>Language is culture, identity, health, power. Revitalization one of the cornerstones of decolonization.
<br>Picking up a language is now easier than ever with popular apps such as Duolingo offering dozens of options for gamified learning.
<br>But for minority heritage and Indigenous languages, digital resources can still be hard to come by. In communities where live classes are not available, learners have little opportunity for practice and advancement
<br>Community members have shared with me that they would benefit from an engaging way to practice vocabulary and sentence patterns on their own time - ʔayʔaǰuθəm Tetris seeks to fill this want.

💪🏽 LESSONS LEARNED 
<br>Huge respect to game developers! Making an interactive game like this with so many moving parts and state changes was a big challenge as a junior dev, and it taught me a lot.
<br>To complete this project I learned: 
<br>-State management with React hooks
<br>-Building a database with SQL
<br>-Deploying front and back end production environments with Heroku & GitHub
<br>-How to use keypress listeners to let users move page elements in real time

🚀 NEXT STEPS & BIG DREAMS
<br>-Deploy for community use
<br>-Add a LOT more language data so learners have access to a big library of material
<br>-Add user auth and profiles where learners can track their progress
<br>-Add images to each example for visual aids
<br>-Add a dictionary page with English-Target Language vocabulary (in progress)
<br>-Polish UI (in progress)
