👋🏽 PROJECT INTRO
    ʔayʔaǰuθəm Tetris is an accessible way to master the basics of Ayajuthem morphosyntax,
    AKA the way small units of language fit together to make meaningful words and sentences.
    Inspired by the nostalgic fun of Tetris, the effective teaching style of Duolingo, the UN’s decade
    of Indigenous Languages, and of course the Ayajuthem-speaking community for whom it is built
    and to whom it belongs 🧡

🎯 PROBLEM SPACE
    Language is culture, identity, health, power, and revitalization one of the cornerstones of
    decolonization. The boom of tech has made picking up up a new language easier than ever with
    popular apps such as Duolingo and Anki offering dozens of options for gamified learning, but
    still lacking in the space are tools for Indigenous languages and learners — most have to rely on organized classes which are few and far between. This leaves little opportunity for practice and
    advancement, particularly in communities where classes are not available. Adding to the
    challenge, Ayajuthem has complex morphological patterns that can be difficult to master as an
    English speaker, and it has been shared by community members that an engaging way to
    practice these patterns would benefit their learning experience -- ʔayʔaǰuθəm Tetris seeks to fill this want.

💪🏽 LESSONS LEARNED 
    Huge respect to game developers! Making an interactive game like this with so many moving parts and state changes was a big challenge as a junior dev, and it taught me a lot. Biggest takeaways:
        -simplify state as much as possible
        -store what you'll need in componentDidMount
        -be mindful of the time certain functions take, sometimes better to just run the steps rather than wrap them in a function
        -setTimeouts don't buy you time for state to fill, they just delay your reading of undefined

🚀 NEXT STEPS & BIG DREAMS
    -Deploy on headless CMS for community use
    -Add more data examples to increase play/learning opportunity
    -Create ability to change timer length
    -Add login functionality
    -Allow users to post their own example sentences
    -Add image to each example for visual aid
