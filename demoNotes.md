🙋🏽‍♀️ INTRO
    -Name
    -Territory acknowledgement
    -Gratitude to Ayajuthem speaking peoples of the Komoks, Homalko *get other names* nations who gave me the huge honour of working on this app that aims to contribute to their existing community-based efforts for language revitalization
    -Brief note on the community *look this up/consult Su/Aidan*
    

💾 MENTION TECH STACK
    -Worked with HTML, CSS, React, Node, Express, SQL to make this full-stack application that includes my own database


👾 HOW IT WORKS
    -While the app is responsive, it is optimized for desktop as the larger screen size better facilitates reading Ayajuthem's characters with small diacritics (the things that look like accents), and it is likely that most users will be on desktop rather than mobile
    1) When the user lands at ayajuthem-tetris.herokuapp.com, they see this landing page
    2) The instructions for how to play the game start to appear, and they are prompted to dive in with the bouncing animation on the start button (if they hover on the logo, they will see this modal with information about the language)
    3) Clicking start takes the user to the active game screen
    4) At the top left there is the option to navigate out of the game back to home
    5) The large text at the top is the English target phrase the user is trying to recreate with the blocks of Ayajuthem
    6) The bank on the right displays all parts of the target phrase each round
    7) The user receives the first block right away and uses their arrow keys to move it left or right, directing it to where they want the block to end up -- where they think it falls in the order of the phrase
    8) When the user is done with the round they click check and see this modal pop up that shows them the correct order of the blocks to complete the phrase. They can compare their answer to the correct one, and decide to exit or keep playing
    9) Each round, a new phrase to learn or practice is pulled randomly from the database
    10) The user can continue until they want to stop!

🙏🏽 WRAP UP
    -Creating this app start to finish was a pretty indescribable experience but I think I can sum it up by calling it mind-bending, thrilling, frustrating, joyful, and massively growth-inducing
    -Big big thanks to everyone who provided input and rescued me when I was stuck and cheered me on when I said "you guys I don't think this is gonna happen"
    -And thank you for your time here watching how it all ended up *thank you in ayajuthem*
